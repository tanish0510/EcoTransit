# Pooling Public Transport Application

## Overview
This project aims to develop a pooling public transport application that optimizes ride-sharing for users. The application connects riders and drivers through an intuitive interface, allowing for efficient pooling of rides, reducing costs, and minimizing environmental impact.

## Problem Statement
The increasing demand for public transport solutions has led to traffic congestion and higher transportation costs. Existing ride-hailing services often do not fully utilize available seating, resulting in resource wastage. This application seeks to address these challenges by facilitating ride pooling.

## Purpose
To create a lean framework that enables users to easily share rides and reduce individual transport costs while improving overall public transport efficiency.

## Features
- **User Registration**: Riders and drivers can create and manage their profiles.
- **Ride Request**: Riders can request rides, and drivers can accept or decline requests.
- **Ride Pooling**: Intelligent matching of riders with similar routes to maximize seat utilization.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Users receive updates about ride confirmations and changes.
- **Performance Tracking**: Metrics to assess the efficiency of the pooling process.

## System Architecture
The system consists of the following components:
- **Front-End**: Developed using React.js for an interactive user interface.
- **Back-End**: Built with Node.js and Express.js to handle application logic and API requests.
- **Database**: MongoDB is used for storing user data, ride requests, and performance metrics.
- **APIs**: RESTful APIs facilitate communication between the front-end and back-end services.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pooling-public-transport-app.git
   cd pooling-public-transport-app
Install dependencies:

## For the front-end:
cd frontend
npm install

## For the back-end:
cd backend
npm install

Set up environment variables for the back-end in a .env file. Refer to .env.example for the required variables.

## Start the application:

## For the back-end:
cd backend
npm start

## For the front-end:
cd frontend
npm start

## Usage
Register as a rider or driver and complete your profile.
Riders can search for available rides by entering their destination.
Drivers can view incoming ride requests and accept them based on their route.
Performance Metrics
This application aims for:

30% reduction in resource utilization
20% increase in performance metrics
## Future Work
Integration of machine learning algorithms for smarter ride matching.
Implementation of a mobile application for broader accessibility.
Expansion of features, such as in-app messaging and driver ratings.

## Acknowledgements
React for the front-end framework.
Node.js and Express.js for back-end development.
MongoDB for database management.
